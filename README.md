Design a class called BankAccount with three attributes: • accountNumber (public),
balance (protected), password (private). I. In the BankAccount class, write methods to get and
set the balance and password attributes, ensuring proper access control by using getters and
setters where necessary. 2. Create a subclass called SavingsAccount, which should try to
access the balance and password attributes directly. After encountering access issues, modify the
subclass to use the getter and setter methods to access these attributes. 3. Finally, create an object
of the BankAccount class and try to access and print the accountNumber, balance, and password attributes
directly. Use the getter and setter methods when necessary for accessing the balance and password or
changing them. Write comment for: • What happens when accessing each attribute directly. •
Why it is necessary to use getters and setters for certain attributes.
